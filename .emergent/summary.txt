The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Qwen AI Automation application from a non-operational state to a functional one. The process began by comprehensively understanding the codebase, reviewing project documentation (, , , , ), and analyzing Git history to identify the last point of work. The core issue identified was a  for  in the backend and subsequent Playwright browser executable path problems. The engineer systematically addressed these by installing missing Python dependencies and reinstalling Playwright, restarting the backend service after each fix. Upon confirming both frontend and backend functionality, the engineer initiated the pixel-perfect cloning phase as requested by the user, starting with UI exploration and screenshot comparison.

<product_requirements>
The primary requirement is to operate and refine a Qwen Clone Application. The initial phase involved setting up the environment, ensuring all services (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB) are runnable via Supervisor, and validating local URL accessibility. The goal is pixel perfect cloning with proper functionality and robust execution. Previous work, as detailed in , included enhancing the frontend to populate dropdowns and send selected models. The immediate next step, as explicitly requested by the user, is to continue the pixel perfecting of the UI based on existing files and a target Qwen interface.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Frontend framework.
-   **FastAPI**: Backend framework.
-   **MongoDB**: Database.
-   **Supervisor**: Process management for running services in the background.
-   **Playwright**: Used in the backend, likely for browser automation; required specific browser installations (Chromium, Webkit).
-   **Environment Variables**: Crucial for URL and port management (, ).
-   **Kubernetes Ingress**: Enforces  prefix for backend routes.

<code_architecture>
The application has a full-stack architecture comprising a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, with a MongoDB database.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**
-   : Provides quick start instructions and initial project status, indicating dependencies were fixed.
-   : Comprehensive project documentation for the Qwen Clone Application.
-   : Confirms application readiness and includes UI/CSS snippets.
-   : Documents successful resolution of external access issues, marking the application as FIXED AND OPERATIONAL.
-   : Tracks completed development tasks, notably mentioning frontend enhancements for model dropdowns.
-   : The main FastAPI application file, handling API endpoints and likely integrating with Playwright for specific functionalities. No explicit changes were shown in the trajectory, but it was the point of failure due to missing dependencies.
-   : Lists Python dependencies for the backend.  was added/confirmed necessary.
-   : Identified as containing the real Qwen interface HTML, serving as the reference for pixel-perfect cloning. No changes were made to this file; it was read for reference.
-   : Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
-    and : These files likely contain styling and scripting relevant to the UI cloning process, which the engineer is now examining. No changes have been made to these files yet.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer successfully resolved critical backend startup issues. Initially, the backend failed due to a  for , which was fixed by installing the missing package (Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://d33sy5i8bnduwe.cloudfront.net/simple/
Requirement already satisfied: markupsafe in /root/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages (3.0.2)) and then all  dependencies. Subsequently, a Playwright browser executable path issue caused further startup failures. This was rectified by re-installing Playwright browsers, specifically Chromium, ensuring they were downloaded to the correct path.

After these fixes, the backend service was successfully restarted and confirmed operational via  tests for  and  endpoints, which returned expected success responses. The frontend was also confirmed to be running via a  to its local URL.

The immediate work before this summary request has shifted to the user's explicit request to continue pixel perfecting. The engineer has begun this by:
1.  Exploring the  directory, noting  and .
2.  Taking a screenshot of the currently running frontend (http://127.0.0.1:3000) for visual comparison.
3.  Identifying  as the source containing the real Qwen interface HTML to serve as the reference for the pixel-perfect cloning.
